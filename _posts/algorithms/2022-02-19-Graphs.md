## Terminology

- Undirected: $E = V(V - 1) / 2$ - a _complete graph_, each vertex reachable from all others
- Directed $E = V(V-1)$ - indegree and outdegree concept
- A path is **simple** if it contains an edge at most once
- **Strongly connected digraph** - node $u$ may be reachable from $v$ but not necessarily vice versa
- A connected, acyclic undirected graph is called a **free tree**
  - If we specify a root, it's a **rooted tree**
  - Acyclic but not connected is an undirected **forest**
- Directed, acyclic graphs are called **DAGs**

## Data structures for Undirected Graphs

- Adjacency matrix: $A[u][v] = 1$ `if edge(u,v) exists` - **dense graphs** 
- Adjacency list: Each edge $(u,v)$ node has a list of the nodes it connects to - **sparse graphs**

### For weighted graphs

- Store weight in matrix cell
- Add field to node object
- Tuples - $(u, v)$ vs the unweighted set notation $\{u, v\}$

# Traversal

**Can be multiple trees for BFS or DFS**

## BFS Shortest Path

- Choose a starting vertex
- Visit in order of increasing distance
- Good for **undirected graphs**

### Pseudocode

### Running time

- Time - $\Theta(V+E)$
- Space - $\Theta(V)$

## DFS

Same process as BFS but uses a stack

- Go as deep as possible
- Backtrack as little as possible until you can find another path down

### Algorithm

- Initially color all the nodes white
- Recursively visit nodes, saving the `time` (**discovery time**)

### Python

```python
# Using a Python dictionary to act as an adjacency list
graph = {
  '5' : ['3','7'],
  '3' : ['2', '4'],
  '7' : ['8'],
  '2' : [],
  '4' : ['8'],
  '8' : []
}

visited = set() # Set to keep track of visited nodes of graph.

def dfs(visited, graph, node):  #function for dfs
    if node not in visited:
        print (node)
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)

# Driver Code
print("Following is the Depth-First Search")
dfs(visited, graph, '5')
```

### Types of Edges

![Edge types](https://i.imgur.com/V0fYF9K.png)

- Back edge - the opposite of descendent edge
- Cross edge - Kind of a different path if you think of it like BFS levels
- Tree edge - actual edges, in black

### Determining if Cyclic

- Back edges (indicating a cycle)
  - `dfs_visit()` sees a `GRAY` vertex
  - If the back edge is a tree edge, then the graph is cyclic. Otherwise, we can color black, and move on
  - **Note** - if the graph is undirected, it's not as simple because the gray parent is connected to the current node, but that's not a cycle

### Distinguishing Cross Edges from Descendant Edges

- Use the `time` counter - if a `BLACK` finished node was done before a different node, it must be a cross edge

### Time Complexity

Same as BFS

- Time - $\Theta(V+E)$
- Space - $\Theta(V)$

# Topological Sort

- Given a DAG, we want an ordering where if there is an edge from $u$ to $v$, then $u$ comes before $v$ in the returned list (based on some starting point, **multiple valid topo sorts**)
- Want to use DFS
  - Use the `end` time counter, and the topologically sorted vertices are reversed, with the ones most at the end first, and vice versa (note: times may look like `start/end`) - no importance of `start` time
  - Ignore descendant and cross edges

## Algorithm

- When you set a node `BLACK`, **prepend** that node to the `topo_list`
- `time` is not necessary for this

## Ordering

- You could flip each edge (transpose) and topo sort, which would create a dependency graph

# Strongly Connected Components in a Digraph

- From any vertex $u$, I can reach any other vertex - therefore, there must be a **directed cycle**
- **Only a feature of a digraph**

## Decomposing into SCC Algorithm

1. `dfs_sweep(G)` to get finish times for $G$
2. Compute $G^T$
3. Call `dfs_sweep(G^T)` **but** do it in reversing order from the `u.f`s from step 1 - this **prevents you from crossing SCC boundaries**

If you collapse that into a component graph $G^{SCC}$, then you have a DAG and could run Topo Sort 

Runs in $\Theta(n)$
