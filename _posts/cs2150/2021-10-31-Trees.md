# Disclaimer

Despite all the benefits of trees, also **recognize the cons**

- Require sorting
- Complex implementation
- Doesn't give a constant time on retrieves or operations, which vector `get()` and hash tables can get you respectively

# BSTs

For operations, see [this](https://www.guru99.com/binary-search-tree-data-structure.%C3%A7) page.

For a C++ implementation, see [this](https://gist.github.com/harish-r/a7df7ce576dda35c9660) page.

## Removals

- Two children - Replace with a successor, a `findMin()` on the right subtree

## Formulas

For an $n$ node tree

- Worst case depth is $n - 1$
- Max nodes is $2^{h+1} -1$

# [AVL](https://visualgo.net/bn/bst)

- The **balance** is $H(R) - H(L)$
- Runtime analysis of $\Theta (d)$ where **$d$ is the depth** of the node being found r inserted. Operations are $\Theta (log n)$

## Insertion Cases

### Single Rotations

**Single** rotation, **single** direction.

Parent **loses pointer** in the **opposite direction** of the rotation (which is replaced by the left pointer of the child), child **gains pointer** to the parent in the _same direction_ of the rotation. If the child has a child towards the parent, make that the child of the parent.

#### Single Left

![AVL Single Left](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/avl_left_rotation.jpg)

**Note**: This does not show the general case, where B has a left child as well. In that case, the left child of B would become the right child of A.

- Left subtree, left child
  - Unbalanced **towards left** means **rotate right**

<span class="red">Pointers Swapped: </span> Parent loses its child pointer, it's right pointer becoming that of the left of the child, child gains a left pointer to parent

Say we have the inserted node, it's parent, grandparent, and grand-grandparent.

##### 3 or 4 Pointer changes

- Grand-grandparent right -> Parent
- Grandparent's right -> `NULL` or parent's left child
- Parent's left -> Grandparent
- Parent's right -> inserted node

#### Single Right

![AVL Single Right](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/avl_right_rotation.jpg)

**Note**: This does not show the general case, where B has a right child as well. In that case, the right child of B would become the left child of A.

- Right subtree, right child (but a **left** rotation)
  - Unbalanced Unbalanced **towards right** means **rotate left**

<span class="red">Pointers Swapped: </span> Parent loses its child pointer, child gains a right pointer to parent

##### 3 or 4 Pointer changes

- Grand-grandparent left -> Parent
- Grandparent's left -> `NULL` or parent's right child
- Parent's right -> Grandparent
- Parent's left -> inserted node

### [Double Rotations](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/avl_tree_algorithm.htm)

Consider the **lowest unbalanced node**, and let it be called the **parent node** in this case.

The insert happened in the **right** subtree of the <span class="red">left</span> child.

Then we perform a single **left** rotation on the child, and a single <span class="red">right</span> on the parent.

# [Red Black](<(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IBxA-bZZH8&t=118s)>)

![RB](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/software/AlgAnim/fig/rb_tree1a.gif)

Red black trees are **less rigidly balanced** than AVL, and better for performance in general.

## Properties

- Root and leaves (`NULL`) are **black**
- <span class="red">Red</span> nodes have **black** children
- Every path from a node to a descendant leaf (a **black** `NULL`) contains the same number of **black** nodes

## Insertion

Insert red, recolor and rotate.

### Cases:

1. New node is the root node
2. New node's parent is **black**
3. The parent and the uncle are <span class="red">red</span>
4. Parent is <span class="red">red</span>, uncle is **black**, new node is the right or left child of parent

### Case 1

Simply make sure it is **black**

### Case 2

No violations! Hooray!

### Case 3

Make the grandparent <span class="red">red</span> and the parent and uncle **black**, recursively.

![Case 3](/static/assets/media/case3.png)

### Case 4

#### Triangle Case

![Triangle Case](/static/assets/media/triangle.png)

Single rotation of Z's parent in the **opposite** direction of Z

#### Line Case

![Line Case](/static/assets/media/line.png)

Single rotation of Z's grandparent in the **opposite** direction of Z

# Splay Trees

Rotate til most recent node becomes root

## Pros

- Easy implementation
- Still $\Theta (log (n))$ amortized
- Good for caches

## Cons

- Not guaranteed $\Theta (log (n))$ for single ops, can be $\Theta (n)$
- Poor in uniform accesses

# Vector Amortized

We have to make about $n-100$ copies for insert

## Inserts

- $O(n)$ worst case
- $\Theta (1)$ _amortized_ for many ops

This shows that although an individual operation takes $n$ steps, a series of $c$ operations takes $cn$ steps, which, averaging by dividing by n, means we have **an average of $c$ steps.**
