description: Here, I follow along with Francois Chollet's 'Deep Learning with Python' book, with a few edits of my own.  He walks us through a simple Deep Learning neural network architecture. 
topics: Basic neural network architecture and some introductory material on loss functions, optimizers, activation functions and more.
