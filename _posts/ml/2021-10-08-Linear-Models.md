description: What are the different types of linear models?  What makes ridge better than lasso regression?  How do we evaluate our linear models?  When would such a simple model be best?  
topics: Linear models, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic-net regression, Statsmodels, r squared, coefficients, p-values, the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, and linear model visualization.
