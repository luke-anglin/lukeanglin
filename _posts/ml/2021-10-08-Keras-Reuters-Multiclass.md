description: A follow-along to the Deep Learning with Python book, with a few edits and experiments of my own.  Here, I look into some other libraries on my own time which help with visualizing and evaluating the accuracy and loss of a neural network.  Moreover, we look at the appropriate loss function and optimizers for multiclass situations
topics: Multiclass classification, categorical crossentropy, and the plot-keras-history library
