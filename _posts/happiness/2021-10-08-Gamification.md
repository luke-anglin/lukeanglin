# Fundamentals 

* Make **progression structures** that are visible to every player
* Make rewards **intrinsic** to sustain motivation and create an **emotional** attachment
    * Autonomous
    * Mastery 
    * Purpose 
> “Extrinsic rewards “can deliver a short-term boost—just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking a few more hours.”
* Put the player's objectives *before* the organization's objectives 
    * Often created through **community** and **competition**
    * Player and organization ambitional alignment is key
* Breaks large goals into smaller levels 

## Components 

* Goal-setting 
* Triggers
* Baby steps  
* Kindred spirits 
* Support systems 
* Complexity increases 
* Repetition
* Freshness 

# Motivation 

Whiles video games are for **entertainment**, and rewards programs for **compensation**, gamification is about <span class="red">motivation</span>.

Gamification makes the <span class="red">organization's goals</span> overlap with the <span class="red">employee's goals</span>. 

## Targets

## Psychology 

* **Distraction Effect** - too much motivation will ruin performance
* **Mental Contrasting** - the best way to be motivated is to imagine the final product and also the obstacle 
    * Avoid the *what the hell effect* 
* **Immediate Satisfaction** - Dopamine is released for immediate satisfaction rather than long-term 
* **Random Rewards** - Slot machines, gambling, social-media scrolling

## Leveraging Pride 

**Competition and social recognition** are crucial to gamification.  Make everything <span class="red">visual and public</span>.

# Tik Tok Case Study

* **Recommendation-first**, rather than choice-first 
* *Information limits* - think character limits, video length limits, etc.
