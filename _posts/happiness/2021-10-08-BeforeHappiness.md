# Positive Genius 

Positive genius is about seeing the full pitcher - not just the half-full or half-empty glass. 

This relies on **perception**. Recall the soldier-mountain example - the soldier who initially perceives a higher mountain tends to have greater physical ailments while climbing. Constructing a positive reality led to success.

# Evoking Potential 

## Predicting Success 

SAT scores, grades, and IQ have essentially **no bearing on success** 

> A coin flip would be as predictive of greatness as grades. This explainst he oft-cited paradox that so many C students in business school end up running companies and so many A students end up working for them. 

That quote also makes me think that A students are less risky.

### The Triangle 

* IQ 
* EQ 
* Social intelligence 

#### The Fourth Dimension 

We have a prism, not a triangle. The fourth dimension is the ability to **see a reality in which success is possible**, rather than the alternative. 

Additionally, to utilize this dimension, you should work on improving your <span class="red">efficacy</span>, or the belief that your actions have impacts. 


# Multiple Realities 

The brain loves shortcuts. Heuristics, to be sure. 

## Anchor Points 

Use shortcuts to your advantage by creating **anchor points**. Perhaps the next time you get your computer booted for work, have the restart screen serve as one. Potential *tell-yourselfs* could be: 

* I am for another kingdom 
* Success *will not* affect my joy 

## Stress 

Stress is not necessarily negative. By changing our perception, it can be **beneficial**. 

## Vantage Points 

You got a B. How did the rest of the class do though? 

Okay, you lost \$10k on stupid trades. How much will money matter in the eternal scheme? 

## Perspective Exercises

Perspective is **in the details**. Here is a fantastic exercise: 

1. Pick a situation. Consider your work environment. 
2. Describe it on a piece of paper. 
3. Write a new description that mentions the positives. The authority you have, the quantity you're learning, etc. 
4. Write a third description that uses *none* of the details from the first two. 

**Sleep** and **time of day** drastically affect this.  The *worst* time of day to see positivity is before lunch, especially when on low fuel.

Another exercise involves attaching **positive descriptions** as vantage points.

1. Next time you see your boss, how many *positive* words can you attach? 
2. Pick an ordinary object. Describe it in all ways. Give yourself +3 for positive descriptions and +1 for negatives. 

## Losada 

Recall the Losada ratio of 3:1 positive to negatives? 

To apply this, compliment thrice for every criticism. In romantic relationships, *five* times. 

## Practical

1. Embrace stress positively 
2. Train your brain with anchor and vantage points 
3. Do social 
4. Eat and sleep regularly 
5. Remind yourself of the benefits of happiness and change 

# Mental Cartography 

Losing our meaning means losing our joy. 

## Strategies 

* Highlight the meaning markers 
* Reorient 
* Map success routes before escape routes 

### Highlight 

Also important is highlighting what might be *missing*. Are there gaps in your meaning? What about your friendships? Spreading joy? 

A *happiness vs. time* graph may help uncover things. For me, I was at my happiest when I relinquished control to God. 

#### Give Meaning to the Dull Things

Dishes? A useless assignment? 

Pick some things you want to learn. Better yet, find how it *could* serve useful in the future. 

#### Hijacking

If food or work is the most important thing in your life, your map has been hijacked!

### Reorient 

Shift your focus from yourself to others. **Altruism** is a strong depressional buffer. 

> When you are most negative—when you are feeling depressed, when you are frustrated about how bad your day has been, when you are feeling inferior compared to your peers—that’s when your world is most contracted. Your entire world is **you**.

Additionally, keep in mind that others are completely focused on *themselves*. Therefore, your moments of public embarassment *hardly register* with them. 

#### Social Support 

Receiving social support is significant. Highly in fact - 0.7 correlation! However, even more vital is **providing** social support.

# Success before Escape 

Map **success routes** prior to **escape routes**. Both are self-fulfilling prophecies. 

<span class="red">Defensive pessimism</span>, the prepare-for-the-worst-and-I-won't-be-disappointed mentality, is dangerous!

## Summarized 

* Diversify your meaning portfolio 
* Everyday, do a meaning check 
* Map your life to desired endpoints, and continually update it
* Spot and remove hijackers 

# X-Spot 

When your brain sees that success is not just possible, but **probable**, success accelerants are released. 

## Strategy 

1. Zoom 
2. Magnify 
3. Recalculate Energy 

> The closer we perceive success to be, the more successful we become. 

## Zoom 

1. Turn large projects into small sub projects 
2. Set milestones 
3. Look *behind*, at the accomplishments

## Magnify 

1. Recall past successes, or **champion moments**
2. Perceive low competition 
3. Structure all goals with a *perceived* minimum of a 70% success rate 
4. Realistic, visible goals 
5. Eyes on the sand, not the rocks 

## Recalculate 

1. Remove excess decisions 
2. Prioritize key tasks before easier ones 
3. Don't look at clocks


## Hull Hypothesis 

Revised for **perception**, the closer we perceive the goal, the faster we reach it. 

The *coffee reward program* study gives us some insights into how to gamify our lives and businesses: 

* Give a *perceived* head start 
* Show progress along the way
