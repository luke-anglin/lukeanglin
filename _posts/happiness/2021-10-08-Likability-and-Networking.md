# Main Ideas 

## People are Emotional, not Logical 

> When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic.  We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity. 

# Networking

## Existing ties 

Using existing ties is a great way to build connections.  Just people one or two degrees out in your network can butterfly you towards a much larger network. 

# Likability

> We are interested in others when they are interested in us. 
> -- **Publilius Syrus**

## Reactance 

Let people know that they have the freedom of choice when you're trying to persuade them.  Otherwise, they'll tend towards doing the *opposite* of what you say. 


## Never Patronize 

Make people feel that there **feelings are valid**.  Here's a quote of how a store-owner should speak to his customer: 

> I told him that I understood exactly how he felt and that, if I were in his shoes, I should undoubtedly feel precisely as he did. 

## Genuine Interest

### Take Notice 

Recognize and give feedback. Recall FDR and Chamberlain's car: 

> He admired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror, the clock, the special spotlight . . . In other words, he took notice of every detail to which he knew I had given considerable thought

### Be a dog 

Dogs are the only animals that don't have to work for a living. We love them because they love us. Love others, and you will be loved. 

> You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

Theodore Roosevelt greeted **all the old White House servants by name**. 

### The Author Example

One NYU professor said: 

> If the author doesn't like people, people won't like his or her stories. 

And it's true.  If you don't like people, people won't like you.  Can you give a counterexample? Didn't think so. 

### Similarity Principle

We like people who are similar to us.  Therefore, show or give the appearance that you share interests and agree with the person on the majority of things. 

### Love your enemies 

The Kaiser, after WWI, was perhaps the most hated man on the planet. But one boy sent him a letter with glowing kindliness. The result? An invite to the escapee's location in Holland, a new life for him, and his mother married the Kaiser. 

Jesus was right. As per usual. 

> But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
> -- **Matthew 5:44**

### How you say it 

We've all heard before that tone is just important as what we say. Let's apply that to persuasion. 

You get a call. How do you answer? 

"Hello."

or 

"Hello!"

One bespeaks **enthusiasm** and that's what we want!  Show how **excited** you are to hear that voice, like a child who can't hold his joy when his dad gets back from work. 

### Remembering 

Remember what matters to people.  Think about the example of the President and his boy's stamps - that reporter *never* would've gotten so far without remembering that! 

Birthdays. Hobbies. Problems.  Don't forget!

#### Names 

Names are **huge**. 

> Most people are more interested in their own names than all other names on Earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it - and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage. 

I love the flight attendant example: 

A flight attendant remembered all the names of her cabin. Not only did letters flow in thanking her, but one man remarked: 

> I haven't flown TWA for some time, but I'm going to start flying nothing but TWA from now on. You make me feel that your airline has become a very personalized airline and that is important to me. 

> Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language


## Criticism, Condemnation, and Complaint

### Criticism 

*Never* criticize others.  It puts them on the defensive and forces them to justify themselves. 

> As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation
> -- **Hans Seyle, Psychologist** 

Additionally, condemning others brings condemnation back to us.  We don't want that. 

> Judge not, that ye be not judged 

Moreover, truly enter the shoes of the one you want to criticize.  Remember the story of Lincoln and Meade - I would've had that man hanged, yet Lincoln refrained.  Had I seen the blood and gore Meade had, how would have I responded? 


### Witholding Anger 

Hoover and the plane - remember what he told that mechanic: 

> To show you I'm sure that you'll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow. 

The Bible gives us similar advice, of course. 

> Be not quick to anger, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.
> -- **Ecclesiastes 7:9** 

Rather than *condemning* when we harbor anger, let's understand that person's actions. 

> To know all is to forgive all 

> God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days. 


### Appreciation

> I will speak ill of no man. . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.
> -- **Benjamin Franklin**

> A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men


> The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated. 
> -- **William James**

I love this quote from Charles Schwab, one of Carnegie's highest paid men. 

> There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors.  I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work.  So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, *I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.* 
> -- **Schwab**

From the same quelle, we get this diamond of a quote: 

> . . . I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did better work or put forth greater effort under a spirit of criticism than one of approbation.

Carnegie even wanted to praise *on his tombstone*. 

> Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself 



### Complaint 

Steps to stop complaining 

1. Step back - view in perspective
2. Mindfulness - verbalize the issue
3. Gamify - each complaint, punish; each grateful plea, reward 
4. Channel - vent in a healthy way - perhaps gym **sublimation**
5. Vent - *calmly* voice and verbalize to an outside source 
6. Gratitude 

## Smile, and Mirror Neurons

Mirror neurons. We do what others do! A baby smiles, you smile back.  **Use that to your advantage**!

> You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you 

Think about hiring. What would you take - \$2,000 extra dollars, or a smiling, happy manager?


# Conversationalism 

The best conversationalists are the ones who *say very little*, and *listen intently*. 

## Exclusivity 

When you listen, the other person must recognize that they are your primary attention.  **Eye contact** is fundamental for this! 

## Listening 

> Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. 

## Encouragement 

Encourage others to talk about themselves.  Bonus - encourage them to talk about their **accomplishments** - then, they will subconciously associate that positivity with you. 


## Know your Audience

Roosevelt stayed up hours into the night studying the diplomat he would see in the morning. 

> The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most. 

## Talk to their interests

If you're getting a job, talk to that hiring manager about how you add value. How you will make *them* money. 

## Appreciation 

Showing appreciation makes you instantly more likeable and conversation will follow. 

### Little Phrases

* Would you be so kind as to . . .
* Could I trouble you . . . 

## Talk less 

The less you talk, the less room for error. 

> Even a fool appears wise when he holds his tongue

And remember - encourage the other person to talk about the positives. Then, those emotions will be associated with you.

## Make the Idea Theirs 

Other people should believe that the ideas you want them to convert were originally their own. We can't change people's minds, we have to make them think that our ideas were theirs to begin with. 

## Agreeability 

Everyone wants to be right. So let them! 

## Gamifying bad Situations 

When someone dislikes you, make it a game to do whatever you can to get them to change their minds. Of course, you can't let them know you're trying - you will surely fail in this manner. But, with some tact and clever compliments, perhaps you can remedy the situation! 

## Sympathy and Ethics 

Sympathy softens hard hearts. Use it frequently. 

Recall the story of Mr. Carnegie and the critic woman. Oh how sympathy fared in this debacle! 

Why do you think people share their injuries and illnesses? We crave sympathy like water.

## Noble Appeal

> A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.
> -- **JP Morgan** 

Appeal to the noble one, and you'll get better results. 

The renter's example says it all. Rather than moving to collect, he simply appealed to the man's nobility. 

"I took you for a man of my word. If I was wrong, you may go freely."

That's all it took. 

Another example - Rockefeller's grandmother. Rather than begging pictures to be taken down, he informed the editors they displeased his grandmother.


# Take an Interest 

> The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure fire way to their hearts is to make them feel that way. 

Additionally, don't think of it just as "I should pay attention to them because I should so that's what I'll do."  Think of it like Emmerson puts it: 

> Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I **learn of him**. 
> -- **Ralph Waldo Emmerson** 

## Find their Pride 

What is the *pride and joy* of this person? In the book, consider the businessman and the old lady - he *knew* how much he loved her home. In that way, he sold her. 


## Share Interests 

You might not care about how clean the house is. But mom does. Clean with her next time, and then compliment her on how spotless the place is. What a diligent woman! 


## Honestly See Their Perspective 

Don't just try to be interested - put a sincere effort into seeing things from *their* perspective rather than your own. 

# Contagion 

Just as *The Happiness Advantage* specifies with the ripple effect, our joy or negativity is equally contagious.  Use enthusiasm for persuasion! 



# "Faking" Joy 

Faking joy may be one of the *easiest ways to incur it*. 

## Quote Montage 

> Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not 
> -- **William James**, Psychologist 

> Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. 

> There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so 
> -- **Shakespeare** 

> Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. 
> -- **Lincoln** 




# Win-Win manufacturing 

Does one bait a fish with strawberries and cream?  No! 

Don't speak in terms of *your* desires, rather find a way to align your interests stealthily. Ask yourself: "What would make him/her **want** to do it?" 

Keep in mind the wonderful rent example using the advantage-disadvantage list from the book. 

> If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.
> -- **Henry Ford**

This is **not manipulation**.  It's just making *everybody pleased*.  The only reason it seems dark-arts-like is because it's so uncommon! 

> Arouse in the person and eager want, and success will follow.

## Find the Fun 

Just as with gamification, finding some way to make activities fun is a tremendous persuasion method.  Rather than forcing a toddler to go to kindergarten, show them all the entertaining activities that they will participate in! 








# Conflict Avoidance 

## Arguments

> A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still 

> If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will. 
> --**Benjamin Franklin**

> You can't win an argument. You can't because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. 

Here's a poem that cracks me up

> Here lies the body of William Jay, who died maintaining his right of way. He was right, dead right, as he sped along, but he's just as dead as if he were wrong. 

## Importance 

One easy way to end an argument is to say something along the lines of - 

> Perhaps you're right. You, indeed, have far more experience than me. I often wish I was in a position like yours.

Don't lay it on that thick, but you get the point. Appealing to a person's **desire for importance** is a great way to end an argument. 

## Disagreements to Arguments 

Disagreements can turn to arguments if you aren't careful.  To keep calm: 

* Distrust your defensive nature 
* Control your temper 
* Listen before reacting 
* *What is the truth*
* Assure the opponent that you will **consider their ideas** 
* Thank your opponents sincerely for participation 
* Postpone reaction until *both sides* have had time to contemplate

## Telling someone they're wrong 

You could make a living on Wall Street or gambling if you could be right 55 % of the time. Yet, none of us can.

Thus, who are we to question others? 

By disagreeing with someone, you have "struck a delicate blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect."

## Subtleness 

Telling someone that you will prove their incorrectness is tantamount to saying "I'm more intelligent with you. Let's compete, and you will surely lose."

> If you are going to prove anything, don't let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. 

> Men must be taught as if you had not. 
> -- **Alexander Pope**

How do we do this? We initialize dispute calmly, with phrases like: 

"I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let's examine the facts together."

## Instant Admission 

When someone tells you you are wrong, especially if you are, **admit it immediately**. The customer who is told by the business that he is right is more increase the network. 

## Franklin's Method 

Ben Franklin was the king of conflict avoidance. To avoid **direct contradiction**, he never used words such as: 

* Certainly 
* Undoubtedly 

This saved him "significant mortification" when he was wrong. 

Some nice alternatives come from Daniel Webster 

* It will be for the jury to consider 
* This may perhaps be worth thinking of
* I'd think the same thing in your position 
* Perhaps this is a unique situation

## Pitching 

Imagine you are pitching a product revision. Don't go in and say "this is my improved version." without first saying "The initial version was great. Splendid! However, can anyone tell me potential issues with it?"

This way, you avoid insulting the judgement of the original inventors.

The ideal is that you can get those you are pitching to **to make the suggestion themselves**. Then, you have not convinced them - they have. 

> With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my systemthemselves.  At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted it.

## Socratic Method 

Socrates found that the best way to convince people was by **asking a lot of questions**. This way, they come to the answer themselves. 

Consider the case of the lumber businessman. He *knew* the pine was satisfactory, but rather than insinuating that the inspector was wrong, he created a trail of question breadcrumbs to the answer - and the inspector came to it himself. 

A couple well-placed, tactful remarks mean a world of a difference. 

### Consistency Bias 

Have your opponent saying "Yes" more often than "No."  Psychology tells us that they will want to stick to the answer they more commonly use within a defined time span. 

## Adversarial Agreement 

> Agree with thine adversary quickly. 
> -- **Jesus**

Robert E. Lee had a bitter enemy. When the president asked him what he thought of the man, what did Lee reply? 

> I think quite highly of him. A splendid man. 

And when questioned about how he could speak such of a *bitter enemy*? 

> The president asked for my opinion of him. He did not ask for his opinion of me. 

## Admitting Fault 

Always **admit that you are wrong** immediately. I adore the example from the author of the man and the bulldog. How did the man speak to the previously condemnation-happy policeman when caught? 

> Officer, you have caught me red-handed, and I am repare to pay the fine. I have no alibis and no excuses. You warned me about this, and I proceeded cautiously nevertheless. 

And not just that. The owner **condemned himself** to a harsher degree in the subsequent dialogue. Self-condemnation forced the officer to take on the magnanimous attitude of gracefulness. 

> If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn't it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn't it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips? 

## A Drop of Honey 

Approach your persuasions in a gentle, diplomatic, complimentary nature.  

> . . . people don't want to change their minds. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly. 

> A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall 
> -- **Lincoln** 

## Showing Understanding 

Phrases like: 

* I can see your perspective 
* In your position, I would undoubtedly feel the same

**Emphasize the similarities**!

# Showmanship 

You can't just say a truth. You have to dramatize it. Voice inflection, motion - think Cicero.

Create a great ML algorithm? It must be visualized! Plotly to the rescue. 

# Competition 

Competition fuels all men. It utilizes our pride and self-respect to increase productivity. 

Roosevelt would never have been president if Thomas Collier Platt had not challenged him. He was giving up, but this man thought so much of himself that he created media attacks against Roosevelt. 

The end result is the Roosevelt of history that we know and love. 

If I'm a manager or CEO one day, then remember this - <span class="red">Inspire</span> the team with competition.

## Pride Utilization 

I recommend only using this when all else fails, as it can backfire. 

Imagine you want a new man to run a penetentiary. One known for shanking the wardens. Use pride to convince them: 

"I don't blame you one iota for your fear - it's a tough spot. Not many can handle it."

## Gamify 

Herzberg found that above kind managers, money, working conditions and more, the greatest indicator that one was pleased with their job was if the **work was exciting and stimulating**. 

# Leadership 

## Positive Initialization 

Coolidge and the secretary. A barber lathering the man he shaves. Start positive, then construct. 

## Replace the But 

Many people try to criticize constructively. They start positive, and then say 'but' followed by a criticism. 

A better way is to simply replace *but* with *and*. It is a sure-fire way to come off more sincere. 

## Indirect Criticism

Don't openly criticize. Do it **subtly, indirectly**. 

Don't like a speech? Too dull? Try the Abbott method. 

"That's splendid. I can see it in the *North American Review* already!" 

That was enough to call attention to the enclyclopedia-like format.

## Show-off your own Mistakes 

Who was the most influential man whoever lived? Was he **humble**? 

Indeed. In a similar vein, flaunt your mistakes. 

Be sure to **initialize** with your own shortcomings. Recall the case of the Kaiser and Von Bülow. He praised *after* criticism. This could have been detrimental!

## Suggestions > Orders 

Everyone despises a direct order. 

Owen Young made his living off of suggestions. Never did he give a direct order. Rather than saying "You should," he used: 

* Perhaps it would be preferable 
* Might you try 
* You might consider 
* Do you think *this* would work
* What do you think of this 
* Let's test 

## Make it a group Effort 

Questions are the key to this. Rather than saying, "Let's fix $x$ because it's wrong and let's do it *this* way," ask: 

* How could this be improved 
* What might we do to 

## Allow him/her to Save Face 

So often, we run roughshod on other's emotions. 

> The one who treads softly goes far 

## The Meat, not the Whip 

Dogs will not respond nearly as well to punishment as they will to a treat. Use the same logic with humans! 

Charles Dickens. As a boy, he was so terrified in his lackluster writing ability that he would sneak out at night to send off his manuscripts. 

One day, one was accepted. Not a shilling did he earn, but the editor praised his work. 

The result is history. 

B.F. Skinner is showed this countless times. 

> . . . when criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention. 

## Assume the best 

Show your respect to others by assuming they already have traits like determination and perserverance, and **tell them** that you see those in them. 
> Assume a virtue, if you have it not 

> Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned. 

## Make it Easy 

Calc III might not be easy. But, if you tell the children that, it will crush them. Rather, encourage by explaining how others have done this before. How it's not all that tough. 

> . . . let him know that you have faith in his ability, that he has an *undeveloped* flair for it - and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel. 

## Excite 

The other person should *want* to do the thing that you want them to do. 

Remember Napoleon's *Marshals of France*?  Effective. 

> Men are ruled by toys 
> -- **Napoleon** 

# Vocab

* Vagaries - unexpected behavioral changes 
* Obstreperous - difficult to control
*

# Personal Ideas 

## Learning Likes 

How do we learn what someone appreciates? How about a personal *best test*. 

"This truck is the best."

"No, no it's that one."

"You're right! That is the best."

Now we're similar, and I know you like truck variety 2. 

## Teaching by Example 

This book is written almost entirely by example and quotes. How much more I have learned through this means! 

Jesus must've spoken in parables for a reason. Do the same, and the rewards may be bountiful.
