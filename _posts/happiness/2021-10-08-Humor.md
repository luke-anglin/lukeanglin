# Comedy Habits 

## Storytime 

Starting with a story levels up your game. 

> Our brains are hardwired to recognize, remember and appreciate the information that comes from storytelling. 

Make it **personal**, and include: 

* Protagonist 
* Challenge 
* Transcending emotion 
* Lesson/transformation 
* Twists/turns 
* Believable 
* Inciting incident - the climax 
* Punch line, where you want to end up 
* Hook 
* Reference opening lines in the conclusion 
* Three act structure 
    * Setup 
    * Confrontation 
    * Resolution 
* Entertainment
