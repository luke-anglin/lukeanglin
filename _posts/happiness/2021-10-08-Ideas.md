# Gamification

* Have communities/teams and organizations be creatable

* Consider how the point system will work - global or not? 
* Show graphs of progress 
* Have the higher permission people set rewards based on reached points 
* Allow different teams to see how others they are competing with are doing to motivate them 
* Change rewards based on ML

# Outsource

Build something that makes outsourcing super easy and consistent
