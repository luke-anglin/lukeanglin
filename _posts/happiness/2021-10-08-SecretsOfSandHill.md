# Background

## Fund Structure 

![Fund Structure](https://www.delawareinc.com/images/limited-partner-vs-general-partner.png)

3 components: 

* Investors (LPs)
* VC (GP)
* Entrepreneur

## Leaving Venture 

Three ways: 

* IPO 
* Merger or acquisition 
* Bankruptcy or wind down 

## Failure 

The majority of endeavors fail. 

# Leveling the Playing Field 

## Asking the Right Questions 

> If you are going to raise money from VCs or join a company that has venture money, the only way to know if that is a good idea is to understand why VCs do the things that they do. In other words, know your partner before you get married.

## Equity vs Debt 

Banks use **debt** while VCs use **equity**

Choose equity when: 

1. You aren't planning to be making money soon
2. The business is risky 
3. There may be long illiquidity periods 
4. You are okay with losing some ownership and decision power

## Convertible Notes 

A VC may lend a company money and say "Pay this back by date $x$, or it get's converted into equity."  This is called a <span class="red">convertible note</span>. 

## As an Asset Class

**Asset classes** are simply categories of investments - bonds, stocks, etc. 

The author admits that VCs are <span class="red">traditionally poor</span> asset classes.  

> . . . the median ten year returns in VC were 160 basis points below those of Nasdaq.  A "basis point" is just a fancy way of saying 1/100th of a percent - so 200 basis points is 2%

## Power Law 

Part of the reason VCs are poor asset classes is because, rather than a Gaussian distribution, they follow a Power-law curve.  

This entails that **a large % of the returns are captured by a small % of the VCs**

![Power Law VCs](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0gBFnkVvIMSWV2i6rFzxdA.jpeg)

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecy 

Positive signaling from these well-performing VCs attracts the best entrepreneurs, and the cycle repeats itself. 

### Winner Phenomenon

In VC, my papa's quote flips - he says "It's not the good deals you miss, it's the bad ones you take."  Contrast this with VC:

> But failing to invest in a winner means that you forfeit all the asymmetric upside that comes along with that investment.

### Restricted Access

* Only accredited investors (with a small crowdfunding $1M dollar exception, but it's difficult)
* Zero-sum game - never another first round of financing for AirBNB

# How do they choose?

Venture returns are <span class="red">also based on the power law curve</span>

VCs look for the home runs, not a *good batting average*.  Thus, as an entrepreneur, you want to sell your business as **one that could be that home run**, not just one that might be a *good investment*. 

At early-stage, there is *little quantitative data*, meaning:

> . . . qualitative evaluations dwarf quantitative ones

The three prospects: 

* People
* Product 
* Market 

## People 

If there is a great idea, VCs assume other companies will try to hijack it.  Therefore, they need to want to invest in <span class="red">your team</span> rather than other ones. 

> So what matters most is, why do I as a VC want to back this particular team versus any of the x-number of other teams that might show up to execute this idea? 

Additionally, the **opportunity cost** must be considered.  If they invest in your categories, they have a conflict of interest to invest in any other great teams that might come along in the same categories. 

**Qualities of good teams** 
* Product-first 

### Product-first 

Oriented on a product solving some problem that came up organically rather manufacturing a team to sell a product (company-first). 

> As consumers, we almost can't imagine what we did before these product existed. 

So, sell your product as though people won't remember what it was like before $x$

> Can I conceive of a team better equipped to address the market needs that might walk through our doors tomorrow? If the answer is no, then this is the team to back.

#### Leadership 

VC's want leaders to appear: 

* Able to attract the great engineers and other coworkers they need 
* On a mission 
* Able to attract customers 
* Able to attract *other VCs*

The term to describe such a leader is **egomaniacal** - this guy has to be *so damn confident* in his abilities that he's almost delusional. 

## Product 

Is there a *fundamental need* for customers and businesses to have this product? Has the entrepreneur *done his market research*?

Generally, VCs understand that until a real product is created and tested by consumers/businesses, it will change a lot. 

> In fact, you’ll often hear VCs say that they like founders who have strong opinions but ones that are weakly held, that is, the ability to incorporate compelling market data and allow it to evolve your product thinking. Have conviction and a well-vetted process, but allow yourself to “pivot”

Can't be marginal improvements, must be **massive improvements**, because people are resistant to change. 

## Market Size 

Follows the power law curve again - we need **huge markets**! 

VCs need to hit home runs, so if the market caps at $100M, what's the point?

# LP Structure  

They are looking to seek an increase on their investment that *exceeds some level of inflation* (i.e. not just the national inflation, it might be the inflation of a professor's salary for an endowment)

## Types 

* **University endowments**
* **Foundations** (e.g. Hewlett Foundation) - bequeathed money from a benefeactor.  Required to pay 5% of their funds each year in support of their mission, so a VCs returns must exceed that. 
* **Corporation and state pensions**
* **Family offices** - managers investing on the behalf of a well-off family
* **Sovereign Wealth Funds** - Organizations managing the economic reserves of a country.  Take the Middle East - oil profits go into VCs to diversify them and dilute over-reliance on that resource 
* **Insurance Companies** 
* **Funds of funds** 

## Investment Buckets 

* **Growth assets** 
    * Public and private equities 
    * Hedge funds 
* **Inflation Hedges**
    * Real estate 
    * Commodities 
    * Natural resources 
* **Deflationary Hedges**
    * Bonds 
    * Cash

## Yale Endowment 

Yale's endowment is one of the best-performing endowments to-date.  Why?

![Endowment for Yale Allocation](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/12/20/saupload_image1.png)

![Yale model](https://ydn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/endowmentWED_mert1.jpg)

### Components

* 72% in **growth assets** 
* 20% in **inflationary assets**
* 8% in **deflationary assets**

### Takeaway

Largely invested ($\approx$ 50%) in **illiquid assets**, meaning they count on the fact that at VCs will relatively eventually **push a venture to an exit**.

<span class="red">Always ask the firm what point in the life cycle they are at.</span> 

* Early fund stage - **less pressure** on the entrepreneur, **more reserves** for subsequent financing, **less conflicts**
* Late - **more pressure** on the entrepreneur, **less reserves**, **more conflicts** 

Additionally, <span class="red">assess the likelihood</span> that the firm can generate more funding based on it's pass success. 

> in the vast majority of cases, your best bet here is to just do reference checks on your proposed VC partners with others in the community to at least get a sense, reputation-wise, for how the firm is doing.

# VC-LP Dynamic 

* LPs are **blind pool** - they have *no say* in the investments of the VC 
* LPs have limited liability - it's the GPs who bare the risk 

## LPA 

The LPA is the Limited Partner Agreement, which lays out the rules of the road between the LP and GP. 

### Management Fee 

Usually $\approx$ 2% on the LP's committed capital.  Also note that when a GP closes with a fund, they don't collect up-front, which would *depress the rate of return*. 

These may change based on the age of the fund - if they are investing later, the fee may be lower because the VC has less time to evaluate candidate companies.

### Carried Interest 

What the GP keeps of profits - say AirBNB sells for 60 million, and the VC purchased it for 10 million.  If carried interest is 20%, then the GP keeps $\frac{1}{5}$ of the profit (50 million) which is 10 million, and the rest goes to the VC, both the remaining 80% of the profit and the original investment.

### Valuation Marks 

Rather than being based solely on security value, like a hedge fund, this differs based on the fund. 

#### Types 

* Last round/waterfall - last round of financing determines valuation 
* Comparable company analysis 
* Option pricing - mathematical model 

### Clawbacks 

Profits are based on valuations of all companies.  So let's consider that 60 millon of actual cash again, and 80 million more of *hypothetical cash* based on valuations.  

If they take profit based on that, and then the companies they valued fail to produce, they are subject to a **clawback**, where they're in debt to the LPs.  

Generally, these are avoided in LPAs with special requirements that a GP can't take carry until they have returned the full quantity of the LP's commitment.

### Recycling 

Some portion of interim, hard profits for the VC are recycled into other businesses, and then the profit portion that goes to GPs and LPs are based on that. 

### Hurdle Rate

Some LPAs include the following provision because of the risk for the LP of investing in VCs vs. other asset classes: 

> A hurdle rate says that unless the fund generates a return in excess of the hurdle rate (this is a negotiated number, but often around 8 percent), the GP is not entitled to take her carried interest on the profits. If the fund exceeds the hurdle rate, then the GP can start collecting her carried interest as if the hurdle rate didn’t exist. So, as long as you clear the bar, you are good; fall short and you get nothing.

### Preferred Return 

Less common, more severe than the hurdle rate is the preferred return: 

> Unlike the “clear the bar and take the money” aspect of a hurdle rate, a preferred return doesn’t just fall away when you clear it. Rather, if the preferred return were 8 percent, the LPs would get 100 percent of the money back until the preferred return is met, and then the GP participates in any profits above the preferred return. In our ten-year, \$100 million fund, an 8 percent preferred return would amount to about \$216 million $\frac{\$100\text{ million}}{1.08\times10}$ at the end of ten years; thus, a $200 million total fund return would garner our GP a big fat zero in profits!

# LPA 

## Invest Domain 

The LPA defines where and how the GP can invest.  

Potential restrictions on:

* Geographic location
* Private vs. public 
* Seed vs. early-stage 
* The **type** of business - technology, construction, etc.

As an entrepreneur, understand if you fit the domain requirements. 

## GP Devotion 

The GP can't play fantasty football all day - the LPA requires they are fully invested personally in the business. 

A **key man**, which is one of said inadequate GPs, may be **suspended** for this behavior. 

Additionally, with enough votes, the LP can **divorce** a GP. 

# GP-GP Engagement 

This is defined in the **equity partners agreement**, and defines: 

* How fees and profits are split
* Who bares the legal burden - **indemnification** 

Generally, this agreement has benefits for the VCs based on seniority.  Those who leave are punished, and those who stay are rewarded.

# Startup Formation 

## Company Form 

**C corporation** 

Advantages: 
* **Equity distribution simplicity** - most startups are reinvesting profits rather than paying employees
* Unlimited shareholders which can have different rights (important for VCs)
* **Taxes** - VCs avoid investing in pass-throughs b/c UBIT in tax code means this would cause LPs to pay extra taxes 

Disadvantages: 
* **Double taxation** for the startup owners because it is non-passthrough, meaning losses can't be deducted from owners's incomes

## Prenups 

Not actually called a prenup, but how do we prevent *founder breakups* from destroying the startup? 

<span class="red">Big Picture: </span>Incentivize long-term service. 

### Founder Stock Vesting 

Reward long term equity holders with some financial incentive, such as increasing your current equity percentage. 

Most of the time, founders are *fully vested*, or receiving the full equity package after four years.  If you're worried your cofounder might screw you, increase that number!  

There are other controls you can put in place 

### Board Seats 

Often, founder seats are **hard-wired** to prevent VCs from voting away startups, and that's a good thing.  Make this dependent on company service so that a non-employed founder (for any number of reasons) can't **rule from the grave**. 

### Blanket Transfer Restriction 

What if your cofounder leaves and wants to sell their stock, preventing you from acquiring more capital because of the competitition?

Prevent this from the start by instituting blanket transfer restriction, **making selling shares only doable with board consent**. 

### Accelerated Vesting 

Two cases: 

* Single trigger - upon acquisition
* Double trigger - upon acquisition and acquirer says "we don't need your job anymore" 

## IP 

Make sure you haven't used *anything at all* from your original company.  

> The best thing a founder can do is invest in a clean room to build his product. 

## Stock Options 

Let's say you've opened your *employmee option pool* to give split 15% among the employees.  You have some different ways you can set up the stock options. 

* Incentive (ISO) - employee does not have to pay taxes until selling, and *because the capital gains tax is less than the income tax*, this is beneficial. 
* Non-qualified (NSO) - less favorable for the employee, they have to pay taxes up-front 

FYI, the NSO is only used specially because of the few restrictions on ISOs, which are: 

* \$100k issuing cap in a single year
* Must be exercised within 90 days of an employee leaving the company 

Frequently stock options are set with **four year vesting periods**, the first where the employee gets nothing, and then it gradually increases after that. 


### IPO Increase 

The time increase from founding to the IPO for startups is changing the four-year norm. 

* Legislation has increased IPO cost 
* SEC efficiency rules make it tough for small-caps to raise funding in the public markets 
* Mutual funds are concentrated in large-cap stocks
* Alternative forms of private financing to public markets 
* More pressure 

This IPO increase has altered the stock option trend for startups.  Now, **refresher grants** are put in place to keep the employees interested. 

# Is VC Right? 

> But, as a general rule of thumb, you should be able to credibly convince yourself (and your potential VC partners) that the market opportunity for your business is sufficiently large to be able to generate a profitable, high-growth, several-hundred-million-dollar-revenue business over a seven-to-ten-year period.

## Size matters 

Choose a VC size based on the potential market size - if you don't expect to be the next Google, you can still benefit from VC help if you choose a smaller one. 

## How much?

> The answer is to raise as much money as you can that enables you to safely achieve the key milestones you will need for the next fund-raising.
In other words, the advice we often give to entrepreneurs is to think about your next round of financing when you are raising the current round of financing.

### Milestones 

A milestone for a software company might be your first, consumer or business ready, beta-testable product. 

#### The Series Lifecycle 

* Series A - I've got nothing but an idea and a heart. 
* Series B - Here's my product.  It's not done, but I have some contracts in the works.  Give me a chance? 

Keep going, keep improving, keep getting funded. 

## Valuation 

You want to thread the needle here.  Too much, and your next valuations will be tough to achieve.  Too little, and you don't have enough to reach the next milestone. 

Additionally, overvaluation at one round and subsequent undervaluation at the next *may seem* like it all evens out, but it **hampers employee motivation**.

Keep in mind that employees judge startup success based on:

1. Comparison to competing companies' valuations 
2. Absolute valuation 
3. Momentum

> Ultimately, the best story for you as a CEO is to be able to point to the proverbial “up and to the right” valuation graph.

### Metrics 

* Comparing companies 
* Discounted cash flow 


# Pitching 

## Foot in the Door 

Avenues: 

1. Angel or seed investors 
2. Law firms 
3. Creativity and luck

## Components 

We need to show that *this company* is the home run.  To do this, we need to include: 

* Our **market size** - consider getting creative with how you show that *this market is massive* 
* **Team** - self-aggrandizement is *not bad* here!  Tell them why *you* as the CEO are the best man for the job. 
    * Be a positive storyteller (of course, with credibility)
* **Product** - show the whole *idea maze* 
* **Go-to-market** - How do you plan, and what are the costs, of reaching your customers? 

# Term Sheet Econ 

## Prefereed Shares 

VC purchases *preferred shares*, which because of the C corp structure, gives them unique sets of rights to other members. 

## Aggregate Proceeds 

Sets the amount of money that is being invested and the stake that will be given to the VC in return 

## [Convertible Debt](https://medium.com/@bsheridan/convertible-debt-in-plain-english-aa0e22f444c9#:~:text=A%20convertible%20note%20is%20debt,convertible%E2%80%9D%20part%20of%20the%20note.)

Terms quoted in this section come from the article linked above. 

A couple key takeaways 

* Typically done in **early/seed stage** for simplicity
* A common mistake is getting too much, with discounts and caps causing too much equity being lost at valuation time.
    * If you do this, make sure you **calculate the maximum** amount of equity you could lose, and what this will leave you with.  Are you okay with that?

> For every dollar of VC you take, do the calculation to figure out what that means for your existing crew of people involved.

### Capped Notes 

> Notes often have a cap, which means, “This is the maximum valuation that my investment will convert at.” Let’s say an investor gives you \$100,000 through a convertible note with a \$1 million cap. That investor now owns a minimum of 10% of your company. If you raise venture capital at a \$10 million valuation, your convertible note holder still gets 10%, i.e. $1 million worth of equity. Of course, if you raise money at a \$500,000 valuation, then your note holder gets \$100,000 / \$500,000 = 20%. In other words, **higher caps (or better yet, no cap) are better for entrepreneurs**.

### Discount 

> This is kind of like a floating-rate cap. It basically means that, whatever the value of your company when you take your first equity investment, I get to invest as if it’s happening at a lower valuation. So if a \$100,000 note has a 25% discount, and you raise money at a $1 million valuation, your note holder gets \$100,000 / (\$1 million * 0.75 = \$750,000) = 13.3% of your company (rather than 10%). Sometimes a note will have both a cap and a discount, and give the note holder the right to convert at the lower of the two valuations. In general, **an entrepreneur prefers less of a discount (or no discount)**.

### Too much 

Improper calculation leads to too much equity being given away.  This causes: 

* **Demotivation** of the entrepreneur 
* **Share dilution** - additional shares may be created to increase the entrepreneur's equity while still satisfying the VC's, which then dilutes the ownership of the employees

## Capitalization 

Often in the form of a **cap table** - specifies the equity percentages.

Keep in mind: 

* VCs have a best interest to **increase the pool size** before financing
* CEOs have a best interest to **decrease the pool size** before financing

![Cap table](https://2utfff4d3dkt3biit53nsvep-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IoW-Cap-Table-at-Founding.png)

## Dividends 

This section is meaningless, for the most part, for startups.  We aren't dividending out cash so early.  This is to protect founders from pillaging, because if they want to dend cash to themselves, they have to pay VCs first. 

## Liquidation Preferences 

Liquidation preferences define the actions for circumstances under which the company goes bankrupt or winds down.  

**Too many** liquidation preferences leads to **prohibitively high acquisition prices**.  Avoid this! 

### Components: 

* Multiple - 1x, 2x, or any number multiple that defines how much of the original investment the VC recoups
* Participating or nonparticipating - whether or not the VC gets to take the liquidation preference **and** the equity value.  The entrepreneur **wants nonparticipating**, and should only accept participating under special circumstances for later round investors 

Here's a good example of participating vs nonparticipating: 

> Assume that VCF1 has invested its \$10 million (for which we said it owns 20 percent of the company) and a year later the company gets sold for \$40 million. Because we have a 1x nonparticipating liquidation preference, VCF1 has to choose between taking its 1x off the top or converting into common. Which does she choose? The answer is the liquidation preference, because that nets her $10 million, whereas if she were to convert into common, she would receive only \$8 million (0.20 × \$40 million). That will leave \$30 million for the common shareholders to take from the acquisition.

## Redemption 

Uncommon, but this allows the VC to receive a refund and give their shares back in exchange. 

## Conversion of Shares 

Sometimes, a VC wants to convert preferred stock to common.  In this part of the term sheet lie the provisions.

### Types  

* Auto-conversion - automatically converts preferred to common stock at IPO time, with a minimum market cap to prevent trading volume hang-ups 
* Voluntary - a majority vote of preferred stock shareholders allows for conversion 
    * This also provides a mechanism for VCs to **restart** the company to clean it up and re-energize employees if liquidation preferences have made acquisition theoretically implausible 

## Antidilution 

Antidilution provisions protect for **downrounds**, when the valuation is lower than a previous round.  Different types favor the VC more or less - one common type is a **weighted average antidilution protection**, which essentially gives a midpoint between *full ratchet* (complete protection) and no protection 

Remember that the <span class="red">greater the antidilution for the VC means more dilution for the founder and employees</span>.  So, full ratchet is a nightmare for a founder in the case of a down round! 

# Term Sheet Gov 

## The Board 

The most important thing the board does is **hire/fire** the CEO. 

### Structure 

Often comprised of one **lead investor** and potentially other investors who run the show for the VC's votes. 

<span class="red">Seat Composition:</span>

* **Lead investor**
    * VC representation
* **CEO/Founder** - sometimes, the founder/CEO places a provision that makes it be in **their name**, which exacerbates the *ruling from the grave* issue.  However, this could be in your favor if you're the CEO - the VC might have to pay you to remove you if things to haywire.  Generally, though, don't mess with this.
    * Common shareholders' representation
* **Independent(s)** - investors, officers, third parties
    * Neutral representation

Wisdom: 

1. Lump preferred stock into a **single voting class**, rather than different ones for different rounds of financing 
2. 

### Actions 

1. **Stock issuance** - the mechanism through which new classes of stock are created 
2. **Corporate actions** - acquisitions, IP sales, etc. 
3. **Liquidation or recapitalization** 
4. **Increases in the option plan**

## Registration Rights 

How are we going to make these shares public?  That's defined in this section. 

### Pro Rata 

Gives the VC the right to avoid dilution in subsequent financing rounds. 

> You invest \$50k in a seed round at a \$5mm cap and own 1% of the company. The next round is a \$3mm round at \$9mm pre, \$12mm post. If you don’t participate, you will be diluted 25% and will then own 0.75% of the company. On the other hand, if you buy 1% of the round, a \$30k investment, you will continue to own 1% of the company. Your ‘pro-rata right’ in this situation is a \$30k allocation in the next round.

### Stock Restriction 

How do we deal with the selling of stocks? 

#### ROFR 

Right of first refusal; says that before someone can sell stock, they have to give the company the chance to buy it. 

##### Purposes 

* Discourages external bidding 
* Allows startups to control whose hands hold stock 

### Drag Along 

Business way of saying **majority rules**.

To provide *some* protection to the minority, there are three majorities needed: 

1. The Board 
2. The common shareholders as a separate class 
3. The preferred shareholders as a separate class 

## Vesting 

Includes the rate, frequency, and whether or not it is accelerated. 

## Other inclusions 

* NDAs 
* D&R
* No-shop 

# Deal Dilemma 

## Economics 

* *Exactly* how much money you want.  Any more, and you'll likely suffer more dilution, whereas less will prevent you from reaching milestones 
* **Payout matrices** are useful when you have dilemmas in liquidation preferences
* **Antidilution provisions** are crucial - if you go full ratched, a down round could swipe your soul

## Governance 

* Is the P series-specific?  Ideally, so that you can easily obtain subsequent financing, you **don't want series-specific P**. 
* **Board control** - common?  More VC power?  Can they fire me? 

# Board of Directors 

## Private vs Public 

**Public**:
* Board members elected by the common shareholders
* Protective provisions aren't in play 

**Private**:
* Varying statuses of board members and shareholders
* Protective provisions may cause a small shareholder with non broad P provisions to prevent an acquisition or some other major corporate action

## Roles 

* Hire/fire the CEO 
* General aid
    * As a CEO, **talk to your board** willingly 
    * Budget talk 
* Approving corporate actions 
* Evaluate CEO and key founders 
* Ensure key contributors have sufficient vesting to keep them incentivized 
* Fulfill legal requirements by having regular meetings 
* **Networking** 

## Non-Roles 

Boards **should not**: 

* Run the company 
* Dictate **product strategy** 

## CEO-Board Dynamic 

The CEO should: 

* Set expectations of board members 
    * One-on-ones are a good way to do this, and increase your likability!
* Agree with the board on how feedback will be given - one-on-ones through a representative? Entire board forum? 
* Agree on engagement between board members and other execs 
* **Orchestrate and agend-ize** the meetings

## Legal 

* Duty of Care
* Duty of Loyalty - the dual fiduciary problem of VCs sometimes causes suits on this. 
* Duty of Confidentiality
* Duty of Candor 

### Pivot Issue 

One company pivots into another's space.  The duties may now have to be split, which brings up legal issues.

One solution is the **Chinese wall**.  This is a formalistic boundary of information between GPs holding board positions in similar but different startups.  Of course, **this only works when the participating GPs are different**.  If they aren't, they'll have to recuse themselves from some meetings!

## Common vs Preferred 

Board members only owe fiduciary duties to **common** shareholders.

## Review Metrics

### BJR 

The **Business Judgement Rule** states that courts can't second-guess a board decision if they had an informed, deliberate decision-making process. <span class="red">Keep good minutes</span>!

This is the preferable for the defendant; the burden of proof is on the plaintiff.

### Entire Fairness

Entire fairness is more severe, and is applied when **the board is conflicted**. 

Asks two questions about a board decision: 

1. Was the process fair? 
2. Was the price fair? 

This is a nightmare for the defendant; the burden of proof is on the defendant him/herself. 

### Trados 

The *Trados* case helps explain these review metrics.  Let's see a **conflicted board**. 

* The VCs with 1x nonparticipation liquidation had less to gain from increases in acquisition price after a certain point than common shareholders
* The MIP led to **non-equitable sharing** with respect to common shareholders and P's 
* Court also ruled conlflicted because it benefits the VCs to finish acquisitions quickly rather than pushing for higher prices

#### Conflicts

* Execs who gain materially
* Independents can still be conflicting

#### Takeaways 

* Most VC-backed startups have conflicted, non-independent boards 
* Always assume in legal situations that you're going to undergo entire fairness 
* Make your board processes **fair** 
    * Hire bankers 
* MIPs - good for incentive, but be careful **be careful about rash changes** that might benefit some more than others and **consider the relative contribution between commons and P's**
* Make sure boards don't overreach 
* Make potential conflicts **open in board meetings** so that you can get rid of them 
    * Document this in the minutes 

# Financing Troubles 

## First steps 

Before recaps or down rounds, we start with **bridge financing** - this is a cash infusion from the investors we've already got, likely as a convertible note or extension to the last round. 

Often, this doesn't solve the underlying problem, but it might be worth a shot at first. 

Other steps:

* Reducing liquidation preferences 
* Pull ups 
* Reverse splits
* MIPs 

## Legal 

* Do full market checks 
* Don't entagle option grants to employees closely with inside financing 
* Use **go-shops** 
* Give other investors (and especially major common shareholders) **rights offerings** - let everyone know that you're getting finance again, don't keep it private.

# Exit 

## Acquisition 

Make friends with potential acquire, and network with those leading the charge.

### Share Transfer

One acquisition method is exchanging the buyer's shares for those of the acquired company.  The board then evaluates the price based on the buyer's shares pricing, and creates a **collar** to insure immense stock movements in the interim of the transaction. 

#### Considerations 

* Is the stock *immediately* **freely tradable**? 
* How are employee options affected?  Accelerated, left untouched, or changed completely?

## Escrows 

Escrow accounts are a form of insurance for the acquirer.  They reserve some portion of the purchase price in a 3rd party account that will cover potential . . . 

* company representation fees 
* litigation costs 
* ownership and claims against IP 

It also may include *bells and whistle* provisions, like:

* Thresholds before dipping into the escrow 
* Time frames for claiming the escrow 
* An **exclusivity period** 

### Indemnification

Acquirers generally want the sellers to bear the legal burden.  Talk to your lawyer about how suits *greater than the escrow's coverage potential* may affect the company.

### Revlon 

Board members are required to act in the acquisition process with **duty of loyalty**, trying to get the **best price for the commons**. 

The process: 

1. Run outreach with multiple acquirers (use bankers!)
2. Consider other possible paths 
3. Consider **go-shops** 
4. Document everything 

### CEO's Role 

The role of the CEO includes: 

* Helping current employees who *aren't needed by the acquirer* exit without a thirst for vengeance 
* Influencing the **organizational structure** 

## IPO 

### Benefits 

Many of the benefits have diminished to date, and that's why we see many more company's staying private.  

* Raising capital - this one can be done easily in private markets now.
* Branding - how many people didn't know AirBNB before it IPO'd? 
* Liquidity - partially.  It's tougher to sell private stock than public, so as a shareholder, this is a benefit. 
    * **Tender shares** somewhat disable the need, though. 
* B2B Credibility - transparent financials and reputation 
* M&A Valuation 

### Process 

1. Pick the **underwriters** and hold a kickoff meeting to pitch your product to them 
2. Draft the prospectus 
3. Price
4. Stabilize (green-shoe)


#### Underwriters 

You want bankers who: 

* Have domain expertise in the industry 
* Have relationships with institutional investors who could be buyers of the IPO 
* Will help create an orderly trading environment
* Will be available to help after the IPO with M&A advice, follow-on financings, etc. 

These guys will take part in the **road show**, figuring out how much demand there is.

#### Prospectus 

The JOBS act has simplified this legal document, as long as the startup qualifies to be an **EGC**, or emerging growth company (has \$1B in revenue)

Benefits of becoming an ECG: 

* Testing the waters
* Confidential filings 
* Lighter financial and regulatory disclosure requirements

#### Pricing 

Too high, and the trickle-down effect could lead to prolonged down spells.  Too low, and the commons feel that they've been diluted.  The underwriters have very little wiggle room!
