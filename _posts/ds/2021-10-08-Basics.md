# Indices 

Indices **summarize and rank** observations.

# Hypotheses 

* Null - nothing special. 
    * If we were trying to see if creatine made a difference, defining values as the *increase in muscle growth*, we would say $H_0 = 0$
* Alternative - special things going on here. 
    * Creatine *does* make a difference.  $H_A = 5 g$

# P-Values 

The p-value is the probability of the **observed outcome plus all "more extreme" outcomes** 

Consider flipping a coin.  Then, the p-value would be the sum of getting 19 heads and one tail or 20 heads and one tail (one-sided).

# Variability

## Standard Error 

Standard error is similar to standard deviation, but is used for **confidence intervals**.

# Measures of Location 

## Weighted Means 

You have a sensor giving bad data a small portion of the time.  You can lower the weight of that sensor while still using it's *generally* decent data.

## Trimmed Means 

![Trimmed Means](https://images.slideplayer.com/27/9207184/slides/slide_6.jpg)

The Great Depression was full of inflation spikes.  To get rid of these outliers, a trimmed mean would be useful.  

## Sensitivity 

Variance and standard deviation are sensitive to outliers, despite their commonality.  

### Example in R 

```r
sd(data[["population"]])
iqr(data[["population"]])
                            
# May have drastically different outputs.  A better choice might be:
                            
mad(data[["population"]]) 

# Or perhaps

quantile(state[["Murder.Rate"]],p=c(.05,.25,.5,.75,.95))
```

## Robust Measures 

* Median 
* MAD - Mean Absolute Difference 
* Robust ANOVA 
* Robust Regression 
* Percentiles
