![Seven Domains](https://i.imgur.com/4gQRnBw.png)

## Seven Domains of a Typical IT Infrastructure

- User - deals with authentication
- Workstation - the computer/office
- LAN - segmentation and authentication
- LAN to WAN - our access point to the Internet, ingress/egress filtering with firewalls, IDS . . .
- WAN
- Remote Access Domain - hotels, coffee shop . . . vpns are important here for encryption
- System/Application Domain - Databases, web servers, application servers . . . this is what attackers are after, so need good encryption

# Linux Folder Structure

- `/dev` - pointers to storage and IO systems
- `/etc` - admin, password and shadow files
- `/home`
- `sbin` - admin binaries like daemons
- `/usr` - unique files to user

# Linux Password Architecture

- `/etc/passwd` - text file, human-readable, the `x` is where the password would be
- `/etc/shadow` - hashed passwords, everyone can read but only root can change it (though I'm not sure why you would)
  - Colon-delimited, user is at the beginning and then after colon is the hashed password, followed by some metadata
  - Metadata includes minimum and maximum days required between valid passwords/password changes
  - Hashed password = `"$id$salt$hashed"`
    - ID identifies the _type of hash_, like `$6` is `SHA512`
    - Salt is random data added

# Windows Password Architecture

![Windows Passwords](https://i.imgur.com/qc77zhE.png)

# Password Cracking

- Active online - _actively_ trying to guess online passwords
- Passive online - sniffing, running a program online
- Offline - dictionary-style, hybrid, brute-force

# John the Ripper

- Built into cyberrange
- `john shadow_file` first time, `john --show shadow_file` to dump the info again

# Drivers for IoT

- IP-Based Networking
- Connectivity
- Smaller and Faster computing
- Cloud computing
- Data Analytics

I can't see clouds, Donnie! - Memory device (_Creed_)

## Impact on Humans

- Health monitoring
- Home security/control systems
- GPS real-time tracking/monitoring
- Online banking, bills, financial transactions
- Online e-commerce purchases
- WiFi enabled automobiles

## Impact on Business

- Retail stores
- Virtual workplace
- Remote sensors
- Traffic-monitoring apps
- B2C delivery
- _Anything as a service_ apps - Uber, Rover

# Shodan

Scours internet for IoT devices

# LAN

- Wireless access points gathers data on your home network, then it is given to the cable modem with a unique IP to work with the Internet (wired connection to ISP)
- `192.168` is not routable on the grand Internet, used for private networks

# IP Addressing

- Four sets of bytes for IPv4 (32 total), decimal dot notation
- IPv6 is 128 bits (16 bytes), colon-delimited in hex

# FTP

- Share files, but not secure! Use SFTP or SCP

# Networking Commands

![unix net](https://i.imgur.com/kY9miEW.png)

# Flags

- `SYN`
- `ACK`
- `RST` - 'disordered' termination (reset)
- `FIN` - ordered close to communications
- `PSH` - forces data delivery without buffering
- `URG` - urgent

# Scanning Method

1. Check for live systems - `ping`
2. Check for open ports - `nmap <options> <ip>`
3. Perform banner grabbing/fingerprinting
4. Look for vulnerabilities
5. Draw network diagrams

## Types of Scanning

![Scan types](https://i.imgur.com/uw6YH4e.png)

# Threats and Malicious Attacks

## Attack Tools

- Protocol analyzers/sniffers - watch network traffic - `wireshark`
- Port scanners - see what ports are open - `nmap`
- OS fingerprint scanners - what OS? Then use OS-level vulnerabilities - `nmap`
- Vulnerability scanners - `Nessus`, `nikto`
- Exploit software - `Metasploit`, advanced attackers write their own exploits
- Wardriving - shows all APs and information about them (secure, not secure) - `netstumbler`, `kismet`
- Password crackers
- Keystroke loggers

## Activities that Cause Security Breaches

- DOS, DDoS
- Unacctepable web browsing behavior
- Wiretapping
- Backdoor
- Data modifications

# Threat Types (Remember CIA)

## Disclosure (Confidentiality)

- Sabotage
- Espionage

## Alteration (Integrity)

- Unauthorized changes

## Denial or destruction threats (Availablity)

- DoS

# Active Threats

- Brute force or dictionary password attacks
- IP address spoofs
- Hijacking / Man-in-the-middle: Evil Eve intercepts communications between Bob and Alice
- Replay attacks: capture/sniff communications and replay them
- Masquerading - using other people's login credentials or forging them.
- Eavesdropping
- Social engineering
- Phreaking - historical, phone hijacking via tones
- Phishing
  - Spear phishing - targeting a specific person
  - Vishing - voice phishing
  - Pharming - large scale 'farming' for one hit

# Malicious Software

- Virus
- Worm
- Trojan Horse
- Rootkit
- Spyware

# Social Engineering

- Tailgating - get into building by following someone with badge access
- Whaling - targeting executives, big fish
- Consensus / social proof - saying others have done it

# Wireless Networking Attacks

- Bluejacking/bluesnarfing
- Evil twin / rogue AP
- Jamming
- Near field communication attack (signal interception between smartphone and credit card)
- Packet sniffing
- Replay attacks
- War driving

# Web application attacks

- Buffer overflow
- Client-side attack (insider)
- LDAP injection - sanitization attack
- SQL injection
- XML injection
- Malicious add ons
- Watering hole

# Access Controls

# Defining Access Contro

- Protecting a resource so only authorized users can use it
- Mitigations to protect a resource from a threat

## Access Contro Components

### Parts of Access Contro

- Identification - who asks for the asset?
- Authentication - can the requestor be verified?
- Authorization - what can the requestor access?
- Accountability - how can we trace actions to an individual?

### Phases of Access Contro

The above parts are divided into two phases:

- Policy definition
- Policy enforcement

### Types of Access Contro

- Physical - keys, swipe card
- Logical
  - Roles kept in SK database, different objects for different users
  - Audit log is the **accountability piece**
  - Controls - biometrics, tokens, passwords, SSO (MFA)

### Security Kernel

![SK](https://i.imgur.com/L4VDtRV.png)

## Access Control Policies

A set of rules that allows certain users to perform certain actions on certain resources

### Four components

- Users - the users or processes
- Resources - the protected objects
- Actions - high level, 'what can you see, what can you do'
- Relationships - `+rwx`

# Authentication

## Types

- Knowledge - password, PIN, etc.
- Ownership - tokens, key
- Characteristics - retina
- Location
- Action

# Access Control Lists - ACL

- Discretionary (DAC) - owner deciedes permissions
- Mandatory (MAC) - determined by sensitivity of resource and security level of subject (military-level, strictest); this is a form of NAC
- Nondiscretionary (NAC) - monitored by security administrator
- Rule-based - rules maintained by owner
- Role-based (RBAC) - based on the jobs a user is assigned
- Attribute-based (ABAC) - more understandable, in business terms, role-based ('executive', 'financial system' . . . )

# Centralized and Decentralized AC

Enforced through authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) servers

## Centralized

## AAA servers (auth, auth, accounting)

- RADIUS
- TACACS+
- DIAMETER
- SAML - XML based markup language for auth

## Decentralized

- Password AP (cleartext) and Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) (secure, hashed)
- OATH - ongoing reference for secure authentication

# Sniffing

## Terminology

- Passive - just watching
- Active
  - Gratuitous ARP/ARP Poisoning - maps `MAC` to `IP`
    - Cain and Abel, dsniff
  - Port spanning - Cross connecting two or more ports on a network switch so that traffic can be simultaneously sent to a network analyzer or monitor connected to another port.
  - MAC flooding
    - Etherflood, Macof
  - Spoofing
    - Windows registrry key
    - `sudo ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`

## Switches vs. Hubs

Switches have intelligence, segmentation and more collision domains than hubs

## Clear Text Protocols

- HTTP (80)
- Telnet and Rlogin (23 and 513)
- POP (110, 995)
- IMAP (143, 993)
- SNMP (old v.) and NNTP (119)
- FTP (20, 21)
