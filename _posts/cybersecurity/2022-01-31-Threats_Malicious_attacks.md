## Attack Tools

- Protocol analyzers/sniffers - watch network traffic - `wireshark`
- Port scanners - see what ports are open - `nmap`
- OS fingerprint scanners - what OS? Then use OS-level vulnerabilities - `nmap`
- Vulnerability scanners - `Nessus`, `nikto`
- Exploit software - `Metasploit`, advanced attackers write their own exploits
- Wardriving - shows all APs and information about them (secure, not secure) - `netstumbler`, `kismet`
- Password crackers
- Keystroke loggers

## Activities that Cause Security Breaches

- DOS, DDoS
- Unacctepable web browsing behavior
- Wiretapping
- Backdoor
- Data modifications

# Threat Types (Remember CIA)

## Disclosure (Confidentiality)

- Sabotage
- Espionage

## Alteration (Integrity)

- Unauthorized changes

## Denial or destruction threats (Availablity)

- DoS

# Active Threats

- Brute force or dictionary password attacks
- IP address spoofs
- Hijacking / Man-in-the-middle: Evil Eve intercepts communications between Bob and Alice
- Replay attacks: capture/sniff communications and replay them
- Masquerading - using other people's login credentials or forging them.
- Eavesdropping
- Social engineering
- Phreaking - historical, phone hijacking via tones
- Phishing
  - Spear phishing - targeting a specific person
  - Vishing - voice phishing
  - Pharming - large scale 'farming' for one hit

# Malicious Software

* Virus 
* Worm 
* Trojan Horse 
* Rootkit 
* Spyware 

# Social Engineering

- Tailgating - get into building by following someone with badge access
- Whaling - targeting executives, big fish
- Consensus / social proof - saying others have done it

# Wireless Networking Attacks 

* Bluejacking/bluesnarfing 
* Evil twin / rogue AP 
* Jamming 
* Near field communication attack (signal interception between smartphone and credit card)
* Packet sniffing 
* Replay attacks 
* War driving 

# Web application attacks 

* Buffer overflow 
* Client-side attack (insider)
* LDAP injection - sanitization attack 
* SQL injection 
* XML injection 
* Malicious add ons 
* Watering hole
